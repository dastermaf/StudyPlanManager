# StudyPlanManager

Hello! This is StudyPlanManager, a web app built to help students at Okayama University of Science (OUS) organize their studies for the autumn semester (秋学期).

## What This Project Does

The main goal is to make managing your semester a bit easier. It helps specifically OUS students by:

* Showing how much time is left before final exams.
* Breaking down each subject into 15 weekly sections, matching the semester structure.
* Listing the online lessons scheduled for each week.
* Giving you a personal dashboard to see some study stats and manage a simple to-do list.
* Keeping notes and extra learning materials from the video lessons together in one place for each section. All this info is under a CC0 license.

## Getting Started

[Здесь должны быть инструкции по установке и запуску старой версии. Поскольку у меня нет информации о ней, я оставляю это как шаблон. Тебе нужно будет заполнить это реальными командами для старого кода.]

1.  Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/dastermaf/StudyPlanManager.git](https://github.com/dastermaf/StudyPlanManager.git)
    cd StudyPlanManager 
    ```
    *(Note: Adjust the folder name if the old code is in a different directory)*

2.  Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    # Add the command for installing dependencies for the old code here
    # (e.g., npm install)
    ```

3.  Build the project (if needed):
    ```bash
    # Add the build command for the old code here, if any
    ```

4.  Run the application:
    ```bash
    # Add the command to start the old application here
    # (e.g., npm start, node server.js)
    ```

## Important Note on Development

Active development and refactoring are happening in the `recode` branch (or specify the correct branch name). That branch aims to improve the architecture and stability using NestJS and TypeScript. This main branch represents the original codebase.
